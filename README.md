Log Cache Release
=================
abcd
Log Cache Release is a [bosh](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) release
for [Log Cache](https://code.cloudfoundry.org/log-cache). It provides
an [in memory caching layer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yhfl0EB_MkHkh4JdRZXGeQMx_BDMCuB-SpPuSrD3VOU/edit#) as a replacement for `cf logs --recent` and container metrics retrieval.

### Deploying Log Cache

Log Cache can be deployed within
[Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment).

Log Cache relies on Loggregator and reads data from the Reverse Log Proxy.

#### Cloud Config

Every bosh deployment requires a [cloud
config](https://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html). The Log Cache deployment
manifest assumes the CF-Deployment cloud config has been uploaded.

#### Creating and Uploading Release

The first step in deploying Log Cache is to create a release. Final releases
are preferable, however during the development process dev releases are
useful.

The following commands will create a dev release and upload it to an
environment named `lite`.

```
bosh create-release --force
bosh -e lite upload-release --rebase
```

#### Cloud Foundry

Log Cache deployed within Cloud Foundry reads from the Loggregator system and
registers with the [GoRouter](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/gorouter) at
`log-cache.<system-domain>` (e.g. for bosh-lite `log-cache.bosh-lite.com`).

As of `cf-deployment` version 3.x, Log Cache is included by default in CF.

The following commands will deploy Log Cache in CF.

```
bosh update-runtime-config \
    ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/runtime-configs/dns.yml
bosh update-cloud-config \
    ~/workspace/cf-deployment/iaas-support/bosh-lite/cloud-config.yml
bosh \
    --environment lite \
    --deployment cf \
    deploy ~/workspace/cf-deployment/cf-deployment.yml \
    --ops-file ~/workspace/cf-deployment/operations/bosh-lite.yml \
    --ops-file ~/workspace/cf-deployment/operations/use-compiled-releases.yml \
    -v system_domain=bosh-lite.com
```

##### Log Cache UAA Client
By Default, Log Cache uses the `doppler` client included with `cf-deployment`.

If you would like to use a custom client, it requires the `uaa.resource` authority:
```
<custom_client_id>:
    authorities: uaa.resource
    override: true
    authorized-grant-types: client_credentials
    secret: <custom_client_secret>
```

### Operating Log Cache

#### Reliability SLO
Log cache depends on Loggregator and is expected to offer slightly lower reliability.
This is primarily due to the ephemeral nature of the cache. Loss will occur during a
deployment. Outside of deployments a 99% reliability can be expected.

#### Cache Duration & Scaling
Log cache is horizontally scalable and we recommend scaling based on the formula below.
We have set a service level objective of 15 minutes with this scaling recommendation.
```
Log Cache Nodes = Envelopes Per Second / 10,000
```

Note - this is intentionally designed to match the scaling of the Log Router used in the
Loggregator system for [colocation in cf-deployment][cf-deployment-ops] - that said more
recent testing with this colocation strategy has not met these SLOs. If targeting these
SLOs is critical to your foundation we recommend using a log-cache instance group.
